# SignLanguageDetector
Goal: Real time sign language detection using sequences

Step 1: Collect data of hands, body face and save them as Numpy Arrays
Step 2: Train a deep neural network with LSTM layers for sequences to predict the temporal component. So that we are able to prodict the action from a number of frames
Step 3: Put it all together - perform real time sign language detection using OpenCV
